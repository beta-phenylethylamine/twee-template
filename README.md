Tweego project template
---

This is my default template for a tweego project, using rollup for ES6 features (especially its nice imports) and sass for some simple improvements to CSS (nesting especially).

# Requires:

 * [tweego](https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/)
 * [rollup](https://rollupjs.org)
 * a sass compiler ([sassc](https://github.com/sass/sassc) is the default, but it's arguments are compatible with dart-sass and the node sass command line tools)
